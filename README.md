  # Algasami.
</div>

My name is Algasami. Interested in programming, I'm fascinated by the world of zero and one. For me, programming is a means of connecting with the world.

## Competitive Programming

Despite that I'm not a big fan of competitive programming, I still find it intriguing as it's quite challenging yet rewarding.
I don't consider myself good at solving problems, but when I luckily know the solution, it usually follows a wave of happiness and excitement, which can never be replaced by others.

### Projects
I'm currently working on several private projects whose details, of course, won't be disclosed. Some are procedural generations in game and render engines.
Others are purely games I'm working on to gain more understandings on software architectures and algorithm designs.

# Have a cup of Joe!

Let's say -- you are interested in Github and somehow have bumped into my profile. Now you might wonder "who the hell this person is".

Okay, take a seat and let's have a chat. â˜•

My name is Algasami. It sounds a little feminine(ignore the gender stereotype here), but I promise that I'm a dude who works out every day (not a gym bro though).
Interested in programming, I'm fascinated by the world of zero and one. For me, programming is a means of connecting with the world, just like how I'm sitting here,
talking with you. Anyway, chances are that you are a programming enthusiast like me, so why don't you take a hot spa, listen to some
soft electronic music and dive into your dreams?

  # I'm Algasami.
</div>


Let's say -- you are interested in Github and somehow have bumped into my profile. Now you might wonder "who the hell this person is".
Okay, take a seat and let's have a chat. â˜•

My name is Algasami. It sounds a little feminine(ignore the gender stereotype here), but I promise that I'm a dude who works out every day (not a gym bro though).
Interested in programming, I'm fascinated by the world of zero and one. For me, programming is a means of connecting with the world, just like how I'm sitting here,
talking with you.

## Competitive Programming

Despite that I'm not a big fan of competitive programming, I still find it intriguing as it's quite challenging yet rewarding.
I don't consider myself good at solving problems, but when I luckily do, it usually follows a rush of happiness and excitement, which can never be replaced by others.

## Projects & Big Goals

### Projects
I'm currently working on several private projects whose details, of course, won't be disclosed. Some are procedural generations in game and render engines.
Others are purely games I'm working on to gain more understandings on software architectures and algorithm designs.

### Goals
- [ ] Get used to state machines and advanced data structures.
- [ ] Be able to find optimized solutions to high-dim problems.
- [ ] Maintain my model student position and even become the valedictorian... ( Perhaps? A very slim chance then )
